# Multi-Threaded Proxy Web Server with Cache
This project implements a Multi-Threaded Proxy Server with Cache. The proxy acts as an
intermediary between clients and web servers, improving efficiency and enabling functionali-
ties such as caching, access restriction, and client anonymity. The main focus of this project
is on concurrency management using multi-threading, synchronization with semaphores, and
cache design using the Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm.
